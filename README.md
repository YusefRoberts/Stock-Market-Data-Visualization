# Stock-Market-Data-Visualization

This is a simple Python script that fetches stock market data for a specified ticker symbol and timeframe and creates a candlestick chart using the Plotly library. The script demonstrates basic data analysis and visualization skills using Python.
Getting Started
Prerequisites

To run this script, you will need:

    Python 3.x
    yfinance library (pip install yfinance)
    Plotly library (pip install plotly)

Usage

To run the script, simply run the stock_visualization.py file using Python.



The script will prompt you to enter a ticker symbol (e.g. "AAPL" for Apple), a start date, and an end date for the data. It will then fetch the stock data and create a candlestick chart that shows the open, high, low, and close prices for each trading day in the selected timeframe.
